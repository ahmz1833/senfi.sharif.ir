# ✅ Time Picker Implementation Complete

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
**Issue**: Users could not select specific hours and minutes for campaign end time - only date selection was available.

**Solution**: Successfully implemented hour and minute selection using the `TimePicker` plugin from `react-multi-date-picker`.

## 🔧 **Key Changes Made**

### 1. **Added TimePicker Plugin**
```tsx
// Added import
import TimePicker from 'react-multi-date-picker/plugins/time_picker';

// Added to DatePicker plugins
plugins={[
  <TimePicker position="bottom" hideSeconds />
]}
```

### 2. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Wider input field**: Increased from 180-250px to 220-280px to accommodate time display
- **User guidance**: Added helpful hint text "💡 پس از انتخاب تاریخ، می‌توانید ساعت و دقیقه را نیز تنظیم کنید"
- **Clean UI**: Used `hideSeconds` to show only hours and minutes (more user-friendly)

### 3. **Improved Form Management**
- **Proper cleanup**: Reset `endDate` when form is submitted successfully
- **Form reset**: Clear all form fields including `endDate` when form is closed
- **State management**: Enhanced state handling for better user experience

### 4. **Custom Styling**
Added comprehensive CSS styling in `custom.css`:
- Time picker styling with consistent theme colors
- Calendar styling to match site design
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Proper focus states and hover effects
