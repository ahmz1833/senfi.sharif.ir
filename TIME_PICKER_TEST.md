# Time Picker Test Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The campaign end date/time selection now supports **hour and minute selection** in addition to date selection.

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Navigate to the campaigns page**:
   - Go to `/campaigns` in your browser
   - Log in if not already logged in

3. **Test the time picker**:
   - Click on "📝 ایجاد کارزار جدید" (Create New Campaign)
   - Scroll down to the "⏰ تاریخ و ساعت پایان کارزار" field
   - Click on the date input field

4. **Verify the functionality**:
   - ✅ **Date Selection**: Click on a date in the Persian calendar
   - ✅ **Time Selection**: After selecting a date, you should see time picker controls at the bottom
   - ✅ **Hour Selection**: Click on the hour field and modify it
   - ✅ **Minute Selection**: Click on the minute field and modify it
   - ✅ **Format Display**: The input should show format like `1403/04/25 14:30`
